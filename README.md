# Privacy Simplified üîí

Privacy Simplified is a Chrome extension that helps users understand privacy policies and terms of service quickly and effectively. Instead of reading through lengthy legal documents, this extension uses AI to extract and summarize key points that matter to you.

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack

- CSS (21.4%)
- HTML (14.1%)

### Components
- `popup/`: Contains the extension's user interface

  - `popup.js`: Core functionality and API integration
  - `popup.css`: Styling and visual elements

### API Integration
The extension uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for AI-powered summarization. You'll need to:

## Privacy Considerations

- All processing is done securely through Google's Gemini API
- No user data is stored or transmitted except for the text being summarized
